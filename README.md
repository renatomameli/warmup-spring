# Warmup Library for Spring Boot

Improve your first-request latency in Spring Boot applications by warming up expensive code paths at startup.
This is achieved by a simple dummy HTTP request sent to the application itself.

## Usage

Other warmup operations can be implemented by implementing the `WarmupOperation` interface and register it as bean.
These beans are automatically collected and its implementations will also be executed on startup.


## Average Results (over many test runs):
Latency of the first HTTP request:
- Without warmup: ~53 ms
- With warmup: ~8 ms

Thatâ€™s an average improvement of around 6.5x in response time.

## How It Was Tested
- Warmup was tested multiple times manually using Postman.
- After starting the Spring Boot application, the first request was triggered via Postman.
- Warmup was tested with and without the library enabled.
- All values were recorded manually across several runs to ensure reliability.
